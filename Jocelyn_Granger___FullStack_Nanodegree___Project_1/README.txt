SUMMARY:

This software displays information about movies. If you click on the information about a movie, the software plays a trailer for that movie.


REQUIRED:

IDLE, an Internet connection, and three files:
entertainment_center.py,
fresh_tomatoes.py, and
media.py.

The three .py files must be in the same folder (directory).


TO RUN:

1. The first time you run this software, you must create a file called fresh_tomatoes.html. To do that,
a) make sure that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser,
b) start up IDLE,
c) display entertainment_center.py in IDLE's editor window, and
d) tell IDLE to run the software.
Result: A file called fresh_tomatoes.html will be created, in the same folder as your other .py files. This web page will automatically be displayed in your web browser.

2. The web page will display information about several movies. Left single-click on the information for one movie. Result: A trailer (clip) for that movie will appear in a small window, and will start to play. On the upper right corner of the movie clip window, you will see an "X" within a circle. To stop playing the clip, click on that "X". Result: The clip will stop playing, and the movie trailer window will disappear.

3. To view the web page again: After you have created the file fresh_tomatoes.html, you can simply display it in your web browser. Or if you wish, you can re-create the file by running step 1 again. (If the file already exists, and if you re-run step 1, then the file will be re-created, and will be automatically displayed again.)
